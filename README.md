Project Brief: the client has several datasets about the operations of the restaurant in 10 CVS files. Those files contain data about addresses, customers, ingredients, inventory, items, orders, recipes, rotations, shifts, and staff.

The client wants me to design and build a relational database that will allow him to capture and store all of the information and data that the business generates which will help him monitor the business performance in dashboards which he also wants me to build for him later on.
